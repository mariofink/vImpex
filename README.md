vImpex
======

Stupid name for a little tool to visualise the content of impex files used by the [http://hybris.com](Hybris ecommerce platform).

## Instructions:
Download or clone this repository and open it in your browser.
Then you can just drag an impex file from your desktop onto it to have its contents displayed in a more readable tabular format. 
If it only helps you to keep away from opening Excel occasionally then that’s a good thing, right?

I am pretty sure there are still some bugs and glitches, so have fun fixing them. If that’s not your thing, you can also file a bug.
