vImpex
======

Daft name for a little tool to visualise the content of impex files used by the [Hybris ecommerce platform](http://hybris.com).

## Instructions:
Download or clone this repository and open it in your browser.

Then you can just drag an impex file from your desktop onto it to have its contents displayed in a more readable tabular format. 

If it only helps you to keep away from opening Excel occasionally then that’s a good thing, right?

I am pretty sure there are still some bugs and glitches, so have fun fixing them. If that’s not your thing, you can also [file an issue](https://github.com/mariofink/vImpex/issues).
